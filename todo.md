#+TITLE: To-do list for frogger clone

* Art
** TODO Create concept art - I reccomend Krita for this

* Game
** TODO Choose engine/framework to use from:
 -  p5.js (Looking very promising, probably better than Godot)
 -  Processing 5
 -  Godot Engine (Seems like a good choice so far)
 -  Panda3D
 -  Pygame / Pyglet
