To-do list for frogger clone
============================

## Art
Create concept art - I recommend Krita for this

## Game
Choose engine/framework to use from:
 -  p5.js (Looking very promising, probably better than Godot)
 -  Processing 5
 -  Godot Engine (Seems like a good choice so far)
 -  Panda3D
 -  Pygame / Pyglet

So far I think p5.js is the best choice, as it will run easily on the school computers.
